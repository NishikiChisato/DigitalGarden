# Tense comparsion


# Aspect comparsion

## Perfect continuous aspect vs. perfect aspect
Let's take two scenarioes as example:

- There is paint on Kate's clothes. She has been painting her bedroom. -> [[Present perfect continuous]]
We are thinking of the **activity itself**. It doesn't matter whether it has been finished or not. In this example, the activity has not been finished.

- The bedroom was green. Now it's yellow. She has painted her bedroom. -> [[Present perfect simple]]
Here, the important thing is that **something has been finished**. 'She has painted' is a completed action. We are thinking about **the result of the activity**, not the activity itself.

We can use the *continuous* to say *how long*(for something that is still happening):
- How long have you been reading that book?
- Amy is writing emails. She's been writing emails all morning.
- They've been playing tennis since 2 o'clock.
- I'm learning Arabic, but I haven't been learning it very long.

We can use the *simple* to say *how much, how many or how many times*(for completed actions):
- How many pages of that book have you read?
- Amy has sent lots of emails this morning.
- They've played tennis three times this week.
- I'm learning Arabic, but I haven't learnt very much yet.

[[Present continuous#^except-words|Some words]] aren't normally used in continuous forms, but note that we can use **want** and **mean** in the present perfect continuous:
- I've been meaning to phone Anna, but I keep forgetting.
> [!info] We can say we are in the middle of doing such action, but for these two words, we don't actually doing it, with present perfect continuous. 

## Continuous aspect vs. perfect continuous
### present continuous and present perfect continuous
The difference between them is as the following shown:
![[Tense comparsion_1|1000|center]]
[[Present continuous]] describs the action is continuous at the time of speaking, whereas [[Present perfect continuous]] describes the action recently stopped or is still happening.

# Summary
The form of verb in English has two dimensions: tense and aspect. The former determines when the action occurs, and the latter determines the state of action(or the perspective from which you observe the action).
