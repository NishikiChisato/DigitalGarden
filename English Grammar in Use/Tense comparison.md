# Tense comparsion
## Present perfect vs. past simple
Examples:
Tom is looking for his key. He can't find it. -> He **has lost** his key. (present perfect) -> This means that he doesn't have his key now.
About ten minutes later:
Now, Tom **has found** his key. He has it now.
- **Has** he **lost** his key? No, he **has found** it.
- **Did** he **lose** his key? Yes, he **did**.
He **lost** his key, (past simple) but now he **has found** it. (present perfect)
### Meaning
The present perfect is a **present tense**. It tells us about the **situation now**. 'Tom has lost his key' he doesn't have his key now.
The past simple tells us **only about the past**. If somebody says 'Tom lost his key', we don't know whether he has the key now or not. We know only that he lost it at some time in the past.

Examples:
- They've gone away. They'll be back on Friday. (They are away now)
- They went away, but I think they're back at home now. (They went away in the past, and we don't know whether they back or not)
- It has stopped raining now, so we don't need the umbrella. (It isn't raining now)
- It stopped raining for a while, but now it's raining again. (It stopped raining in the past, there is no connection with now)

You can use the present perfect for new or recent happenings:
- I've repaired the washing machine. It's working OK now.
- 'Hannah has had a baby! It's a boy.' 'That's great news.'

Usually, you can also use the past simple:
- I repaired the washing machine. It's working OK now.

Use the past simple for things that are not recent or new:
- Mozart was a composer. He wrote more than 600 pieces of music.
- My mother grew up in Italy.

We use the present perfect to [[Present perfect simple#^meaning-news|give new information]]. But if we continue to talk about it, we normally use the past simple:
A: Ow! **I've burnt** my self.
B: How **did** you **do** that? (not have you done)
A: I **picked** up a hot dish. (not have picked)

A: Look! Somebody has spilt something on the sofa.
B: Well, it **wasn't** me. I **didn't do** it. (not hasn't been/haven't done)

Because the present perfect describes present situation, we don't use it when we talk about a finished time(yesterday/last year/ten minutes ago). For these situations, we use a past tense:
- It **was** very code yesterday. (not has been)
- Paul and Lucy **arrived** ten minutes ago. (not have arrived)
- **Did** you **eat** a lot of sweets when you **were** a child? (not have you eaten)
- I **got** home late last night. I **was** very tired and **went** straight to bed.

When we ask with When...? or What time...?, we usually use with past:
- **When** did your friends **arrive**? (not have...arrived)
- **What time did** you **finish** work?

Compare the following examples:
- Tom has lost his key. He can't get into the house. -> Tome lost his key yesterday. He couldn't get into the house.
- Is Carla here or has she left? -> When did Carla leave?

We use the present perfect for a period of time that continues unitl now. For example: today/this week/since 2010:
- I've done a lot of work today.
- It hasn't rained this week.
- Have you seen Anna this morning? (It's still morning now)
- Have you seen Ben recently? (in the last few days or weeks)
- I've been working here since 2010. (I still work here now)
- I don't know where Lisa is. I haven't seen her. (I haven't seen her recently)
- We've been waiting for an hour. (we are still waiting now)
- Jack lives in Los Angeles. He has lived there for seven years. (he still lives there)
- I've never ridden a house. (in my life)
- It's the last day of your holiday. You say: It's been a really good holiday. I've really enjoyed it.

We use the past cimple for a finished time in the past. For example: yesterday/last week/from 2010 to 2014:
- I did a lot of work yesterday.
- It didn't rain last week.
- Did you see Anna this morning? (it's now afternoon or evening, not morning)
- Did you see Ben on Sunday? (today isn't Sunday)
- I worked here from 2010 20 2014. (I don't work here now)
- A: Was Lisa at the party on Sunday? -> B: I don't think so. I didn't see her. (again, today isn't Sunday)
- We waited(or were waiting) for an hour. (we're no longer waiting now)
- Jack lived in New York for ten years. Now he lives in Los Angeles. (in the past, he lived in New York, but now he doesn't)
- I never rode a bike when I was a child. (I never rode a bike in the past, but now maybe I do or don't)
- After you come back from holiday you say: It was a really goo d holiday. I really enjoyed it. (holiday has passed, now isn't in holiday)

# Aspect comparsion

## Perfect continuous aspect vs. perfect simple aspect
### Differences
Let's take two scenarioes as example:
- There is paint on Kate's clothes. She has been painting her bedroom. -> [[Present perfect continuous]]
We are thinking of the **activity itself**. It doesn't matter whether it has been finished or not. In this example, the activity has not been finished.
- The bedroom was green. Now it's yellow. She has painted her bedroom. -> [[Present perfect simple]]
Here, the important thing is that **something has been finished**. 'She has painted' is a completed action. We are thinking about **the result of the activity**, not the activity itself.

We can use the *continuous* to say *how long*(for something that is still happening):
- How long have you been reading that book?
- Amy is writing emails. She's been writing emails all morning.
- They've been playing tennis since 2 o'clock.
- I'm learning Arabic, but I haven't been learning it very long.

We can use the *simple* to say *how much, how many or how many times*(for completed actions):
- How many pages of that book have you read?
- Amy has sent lots of emails this morning.
- They've played tennis three times this week.
- I'm learning Arabic, but I haven't learnt very much yet.

[[Present continuous#^except-words|Some words]] aren't normally used in continuous forms, but note that we can use **want** and **mean** in the present perfect continuous:
- I've been meaning to phone Anna, but I keep forgetting.
> [!info] We can say we are in the middle of doing such action, but for these two words, we don't actually doing it, with present perfect continuous. 

#### Similarities
We can use either the continuous or simple with **live** and **work**:
- Julia has been living in this house for a long time. or Julia has lived...
- How long have you been working here? or How long have you worked here?


## Continuous aspect vs. perfect continuous aspect
### present continuous and present perfect continuous
The difference between them is as the following shown:
![[Tense comparsion_1|1000|center]]
[[Present continuous]] describs the action is continuous at the time of speaking, whereas [[Present perfect continuous]] describes the action recently stopped or is still happening.

# Summary
The form of verb in English has two dimensions: tense and aspect. The former determines when the action occurs, and the latter determines the state of action(or the perspective from which you observe the action).
