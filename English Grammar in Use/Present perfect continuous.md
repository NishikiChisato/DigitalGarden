# Structure
The present perfect continuous is have/has been + -ing. For examples:

'Is it raining?'
'No, but the ground is wet. It's been raining.'

# Meaning
We use present perfect continuous for an activity that has recently stopped or just stopped:
- Why are you out of breath? Have you been running? -> now, I'm not running.
- Paul is very tired. He's been working hard. -> now, he isn't working.
- Why are you so tired? What have you been doing? -> you did something before now, and now I have done it.
- I've been talking to Amanda and she agrees with me.
- Where have you been? I've been looking for you.

With **how long, for... and since...**, we can use present perfect continuous for the activity that is still happening or has just stopped. In this meaning, continuous can be interpret how long.

Compared to the former, this usage supports the activity that is still happening:
- It began raining two hours ago and it's still raining. How long has it been raining? It's been raining for two hours.
- How long have you been learning English? -> you're still learning English.
- Ben is watching TV. He's been watching TV all day. -> this activity is still happening
- WHere have you been? I've been looking for you for the last half hour. -> just stopped
- Chris hasn't been feeling weel recently. -> recently stopped

With this meaning, we can use the present perfect continuous for repeated actions:
- Silvia is a very good tennis player. She's been playing since she was eight.
- Every morning they meet in the same cafe. They've been going there for years.
In essence, when we use present perfect continuous with **how long/for/since**, we means that the activity started in the past and just stopped or is still happening.

This meaning is essentially similar to the [[Present perfect simple#^meaning-until-now]], but the difference lies in **present perfect continuous has extra meaning based on present perfect, that is activity just stopped or is still happening**.
