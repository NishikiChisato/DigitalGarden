# Basic
We use **for** and **since** to say how long something has been happening. We use for + a period of time, whereas since + the start of a period. As follows:

![[for and since|1000|center]]
Examples:
- Sally has been working here for six months. -> Sally has been working here since April.
- I haven't seen Tom for three days. -> I haven't seen Tom since Monday.

|                   for                   |                           since                           |
| :-------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------: |
| two hours/a long time/a week/ages/years | 8 o'clock/Monday/April/2001/lunchtime/we arrived/I got up |

We often leave out **for**, but not usually in negative sentences:
- They've been married for ten years. -> They've been married ten years.
- They haven't had a holiday for ten years. (we need for in negative sentence)

For negative, we can use **in** instead of **for**:
- They haven't had a holiday in ten years.

We don't use for + all(all day/all my life):
- I've lived there all my live.

# Question
When we ask a question with **when**, we usually use past simple; whereas when we ask a question with **how long**, we usually use present perfect(simple/continuous).
- When did it start raining? (past simple) -> It started raining an hour ago/at 1 o'clock. (a time point in the past)
- How long has it been raining? (present perfect continuous) -> It's been raining for an hour/since 1 o'clock. (the period of time)
- When did Joe and Kate first meet? -> They first met a long time ago/When they were at school. (a time point in the past)
- How long have they known each other? -> They've known each other for a long time/since they were at school. (the period of time)

We can say, **for** and **since** should be used with present perfect continuous, a time in the past should be used with past simple.

Based on such meaning, we can say:

|    it is    |   a long time    | since something happened |
| :---------: | :--------------: | :----------------------: |
| it has been | six months(etc.) | since something happened |
Examples:
- It's two years since I last saw Joe. -> It's been two years since I last saw Joe.
- It's ages since we went to the cinema. -> It's been ages since we went to the cinema.
- How long is it since Mrs Hill died? -> How long has it been since Mrs Hill died?
