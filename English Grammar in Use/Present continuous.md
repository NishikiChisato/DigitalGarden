# Except words
We use continuous forms for actions and happenings that have started but not finished. But some verbs are not normally used in this way:

The following verbs are not normally used in present continuous(instead, used in present simple):
- like/want/need/prefer
- know/realise/understand/recognise
- believe/suppose/remember/mean
- belong/fit/contain/consist/seem

We don't say 'I am knowing', 'they are liking'. We say 'I know', 'they like'.

Examples:
- I'm hungry. I want something to eat. (not I'm wanting)
- Do you understand when I mean?
- Anna doesn't seem very happy right now.
