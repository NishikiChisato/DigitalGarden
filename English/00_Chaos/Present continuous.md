# Example
Sarah is in her car. She is on her way to work. -> She **is driving** to work.

This means: she is driving now, at the time of speaking, and the action is not finished.

am/is/are + -ing is present

# Sematic

To express action is happening at the time of speaking.

I'm doing something = I started doing it and I haven't finished; I'm in the middle of doing it.
- Let's go out now. It isn't raining any more.
- How's your new job? Are you enjoying it?

To express action started in the past and don't finish yet.

Sometimes the action is not happening at the time of speaking. For example: Steve is talking to a friend on the phone. He says, I'm reading a really good book at the moment. It's about a man who...

Steve says 'I'm reading ...' but he is not reading the book at the time of speaking. He means that he has started reading the book, but has not finished it yet. He is in the middle of reading it.
Examples:
- Kate wants to work in Italy, so she's learning Italian. (Perhaps she isn't learning Italian at the time of speaking.)
- Some friends of mine are building their own house. They hope to finish it next summer.

To express a change that has started to happen.

We use the present continuous when we talk about a change that has started to happen. We often use these verbs in this way:
- getting,becoming,changing,improving,starting,beginning,increasing,raising,falling,growing

Examples:
- Is your English getting better? (not Does your English get better)
- The population of the world is increasing very fast. (not increases)
- At first I didn't like my job, but I'm starting to enjoy it now. (not I start)

# Words with present continuous

You can use the present continuous with today/this week/this year etc. (periods around now):
A: You're working hard today. (not you work hard today); B: Yes, I have a lot to do.
The company I work for isn't doing so well this year.

# Except words
We use continuous forms for actions and happenings that have started but not finished. But some verbs are not normally used in this way:

The following verbs are not normally used in present continuous(instead, used in present simple):
- like/want/need/prefer
- know/realise/understand/recognise
- believe/suppose/remember/mean
- belong/fit/contain/consist/seem
^except-words

We don't say 'I am knowing', 'they are liking'. We say 'I know', 'they like'.

Examples:
- I'm hungry. I want something to eat. (not I'm wanting)
- Do you understand when I mean?
- Anna doesn't seem very happy right now.
