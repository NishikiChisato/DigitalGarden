### 6.1 Examples of Past Continuous

Yesterday Karen and Joe played tennis. They started at 10 o'clock and finished at 11.30. So, at 10.30 they were playing tennis.

They were playing = they were in the middle of playing, they had not finished

### 6.2 Semantic of Past Continuous

I was doing something = I was in the middle of doing it at a certain time. The action or situation started before this time, but had not finished:

​

PastPastNowI started doingI finished doingI was doing

​

Examples:

- This time last year I was living in Hong Kong.
    
- What were you doing at 10 o'clock last night?
    
- I waved to Helen, but she wasn't looking.
    

### 6.3 Comparing Past Continuous with Past Simple

I was doing = in the middle of an action

- We were walking home when I met Dan. (in the middle of walking home)
    
- Kate was watching TV when we arrived. (in the middle of watching TV)
    

I did = a complete action

- We walked home after the party last night. (this is a complete action)
    
- Kate watched TV a lot when she was ill last year. (last, she watched TV, still describing a complete action)
    

### 6.4 Combining Past Continuous and Past Simple

You can say that something happened (Past Simple) in the middle of something else (Past Continuous):

- Matt phoned while we were having dinner.
    
- It was raining when I got up.
    
- I was you in the part yesterday. You were sitting on the grass and reading a book.
    
- I hurt my back while I was working in the garden.
    

Besides, we use the Past Simple to say that one thing **happened after** another:

- I was walking along the road when I saw Dan. So I stopped, and we talked for a while.
    

Compare:

- When Karen arrived, we were having dinner. (=we had already started before she arrived)
    
- When Karen arrived, we had dinner. (=Karen arrived, and after that, we had dinner)
