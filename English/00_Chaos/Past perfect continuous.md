# Examples

Yesterday morning I got up and looked out of the window. The sun was shining, but the ground was very wet. -> It had been raining.
It was not raining when I looked out of the window. The sun was shining. But it **had been raining** before.
had been -ing is the past perfect continuous.

More examples:
- My hands were dirty because I'd been repairing my bike.
- Tom was tired when he got home. He'd been working hard all day.
- I went to Madrid a few years ago and stayed with a friend of mine. She hadn't been living there very long, but she knew the city very well.

We can say that something had been happening before something else happened:
- We **had been playing** tennis for about half an hour when it **started** to rain heavily.

Some verbs aren't normally used in continuous forms:
- We were good friends. We had known each other for years. (not had been knowing)
- A few years ago Lisa cut her hair really short. I was surprised because she had always had long hair. (not she had been having)

- I started working at the company a few years ago. At the time I started, Joe **had already been working** there fore two years. (not was already working)
- Joe still works for the company. He **has been working** there a long time now. (not he had been working)
