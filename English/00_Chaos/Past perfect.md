# Examples

Sarah and Paul went to the same party last week, but they didn't see each other. Paul left the party at 10.30 and Sarah arrived at 11 o'clock.
So when Sarah arrived at the party, Paul wasn't there. -> He **had gone** home.
The past perfect simple is had + past participle.

Sometimes we talk about something that happened in the past:
- Sarah arrived at the party.
But this is the starting point of the story. Then, if we want to **talk about things that happened before this time**, we use the past perfect:
- When Sarah arrived at the party, Paul had already gone home.

More examples:
- When we got home last night, we found that somebody had broken into the flat. -> something happened before the time in the past.
- Karen didn't come to the cinema with us. She'd already seen the movie. -> the time she saw the movie is before we came.
- At first I though I **had done** the ring thing, but I soon realised that I **had made** a big mistake.
- The people sitting next to me on the plane were nervous. They hadn't flown before. or They'd never flown before.
