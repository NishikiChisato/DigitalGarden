have and have got (= for possession, relationships, illnesses, appointments)

We can use have or have got. There is no difference in meaning. We can say:
- They have a new car. or They've got a new car. -> possession
- Lisa has two brothers or List has got two brothers. -> relationships
- I have a headache. or I've got a headache. -> illnesses
- Our house has a small garden. or Our house has got a small garden. -> possession
- He has a few problems. or He's got a few problems. -> possession
- I have a driving lesson tomorrow. or I've got a driving lesson tomorrow. -> appointments

With these meanings, we don't use **continuous forms**:
- We're enjoying our holiday. We have/ We've got a nice room in the hotel. (not We're having a nice room)

For the past we use had (usually without got):
- Lisa had long hair when she was a child. (not Lisa had got)

In questions and negative sentences there are three possible forms:
- Do you have any questions? -> I don't have any questions.
- Have you got any questions? -> I haven't got any questions.
- Have you any questions? (less usual) -> I haven't any questions. (less usual)
- Does hse have a car? -> She doesn't have a car.
- Has she got a car? -> She hasn't got a car.
- Has she a car? (lsss usual) -> She hasn't a car. (less usual)

In past questions and negative sentences, we use did/didn't:
- Did you have a car when you were living in Paris?
- I didn't have my phone, so I couldn't call you.
- Lisa had long hair, didn't she?

We also use have (but not have got) for things we do or experience. For examples:

| have |                  breakfast/dinner/a cup of coffee/something to eat etc.                   |
| :--: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| have | a bath/a shower/a swim/a break/a rest/a party/a holiday/an accident/an experience/a dream |
| have |                                   a look(at something)                                    |
| have |                     a chat/a discussion/a conversation(with somebody)                     |
| have |                          trouble/difficulty/fun/a good time etc.                          |
| have |                               a baby(give birth to a baby)                                |

Have got is not possible in these expressions. Compare:
- Somethimes I have a sandwich for my lunch. (not I've got)
- *but* I've got/I have some sandwiches. Would you like one? -> express possession

You can use continuous forms with these expressions(things we do or experience):
- We're enjoying our holiday. We're having a great time.
- 'Where's Mark?' 'He's having a shower.'

In questions and negative sentences we usu do/does/did:
- I don't usually have a big breakfast. (not I usually haven't)
- Where **does** Chris usually **have** lunch?
- **Did** you have **trouble** finding somewhere to stay? (not Had you)
